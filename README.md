This project focuses on the analysis of meteorological data obtained from Open-Meteo for several Iranian cities, including Tehran, Karaj, Qom, Semnan, and Saveh.
The notebook implements the following steps:

Data preprocessing and cleaning, including handling missing values, type optimization, and temperature categorization.

Statistical analysis of key variables such as average rainfall and snowfall across the studied cities.

Data visualization, where comparative climate maps are generated using Matplotlib and Basemap to illustrate spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature variations.

The main objective of this project is to provide insights into urban climate differences and highlight weather trends through clear visual representations and analytical results.
